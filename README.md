# Create a Simple CLI with Shell Script
This repository was created to supplement [Shell CLI Tutorial](https://medium.com/@rdavid1099/create-a-simple-cli-with-shell-script-1-of-2-e9b22c7f1eaa) hosted on Medium.com.

Each branch corresponds with a section of the tutorial and is meant to be used as a safety net if you get stuck or run into an impassable error.
